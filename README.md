# Pokedex with Pok√©Api

**I created a Pokedex web page that shows 6 random pokemons by their id, and also a search bar to search your favorite pokemon :3**

_In the future i'm going to put the 898 pokemons but for now that's what i got_

### Things you need
Now the only thing that you need for this webpage to work is to have internet, and that's all
